					<p class="strong">Outsourcing your customer service makes customer support available 24/7. Specialty's call center services can help you deliver amazing customer experiences 24 hours a day. </p>
					<p class="text-lg">We know how critical customer service is to your business. So, we've developed internal assessment tools to make sure our agents are performing at an exceptional level. Our call center agents' pay is based on monthly scoring for things like first call resolution and brand representation. And, with our online portal, you can play a part in our quality assurance monitoring by listening to calls and rating the operators handling your calls.</p>

							<p>Allowing our agents to utilize your existing customer relationship management system or helpdesk takes the headache out of customer service outsourcing. We can work with your current software, e.g. Salesforce, Zoho, or Zendesk, access customers' information, and instantly enter data into the software you're already using.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="02">
							<p>Giving your customers a seamless, friendly experience is our top priority. We do this by training our agents to ensure they are handling each situation perfectly and delivering an amazing customer experience every time. In addition, each group of agents is monitored by a team lead that makes sure your brand is always being represented.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="03">
							<p>We believe that incorporating quality management, control, and monitoring brings out the best in our resources and maintains superior quality at each stage of the process.  Our strict adherence to the Six Sigma methodology of increasing process capability, reducing re-work, and increasing the quality of our performance has kept our productivity level consistently on an increase. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="04">
							<p>Quality monitoring is the initial, and the most crucial step in maintaining high operational quality. SORS follows a few simple procedures for effective call center quality monitoring and management. These steps are followed at regular intervals to make the employees aware of the existing levels of performance and also of any changes or improvements to the process, made either by the company or the client. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="05">
							<p>Our agents undergo a thorough quality check process. They are tested on speed and accuracy of processing information, based on predetermined CTQ (Critical to Quality) fields. The performance monitoring report highlights the areas of opportunity for the agents with recommendations to improve. The recurring errors are documented and eliminated.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="06">
							<p>The call center quality assurance team works together with the training department to provide effective coaching to the new agents and to develop areas of opportunity for agents already on the floor. <br>The quality assurance reporting plan comprises daily, weekly and monthly accuracy and speed level reports. Reports on the agent's performance trends are also sent to the client.</p>
