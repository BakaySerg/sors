					<p class="text-lg">We know how critical customer service is to your business. So, we've developed internal assessment tools to make sure our agents are performing at an exceptional level. Our call center agents' pay is based on monthly scoring for things like first call resolution and brand representation. And, with our online portal, you can play a part in our quality assurance monitoring by listening to calls and rating the operators handling your calls.</p>

							<p>Allowing our agents to utilize your existing customer relationship management system or helpdesk takes the headache out of customer service outsourcing. We can work with your current software, e.g. Salesforce, Zoho, or Zendesk, access customers' information, and instantly enter data into the software you're already using.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="02">
							<p>Giving your customers a seamless, friendly experience is our top priority. We do this by training our agents to ensure they are handling each situation perfectly and delivering an amazing customer experience every time. In addition, each group of agents is monitored by a team lead that makes sure your brand is always being represented.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="03">
							<p>We believe that incorporating quality management, control, and monitoring brings out the best in our resources and maintains superior quality at each stage of the process.  Our strict adherence to the Six Sigma methodology of increasing process capability, reducing re-work, and increasing the quality of our performance has kept our productivity level consistently on an increase. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="04">
							<p>Quality monitoring is the initial, and the most crucial step in maintaining high operational quality. SORS follows a few simple procedures for effective call center quality monitoring and management. These steps are followed at regular intervals to make the employees aware of the existing levels of performance and also of any changes or improvements to the process, made either by the company or the client. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="05">
							<p>Our agents undergo a thorough quality check process. They are tested on speed and accuracy of processing information, based on predetermined CTQ (Critical to Quality) fields. The performance monitoring report highlights the areas of opportunity for the agents with recommendations to improve. The recurring errors are documented and eliminated.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="dark__slide swiper-slide" data-double-text="06">
							<p>The call center quality assurance team works together with the training department to provide effective coaching to the new agents and to develop areas of opportunity for agents already on the floor. <br>The quality assurance reporting plan comprises daily, weekly and monthly accuracy and speed level reports. Reports on the agent's performance trends are also sent to the client.</p>

						<div class="accordion__hidden">
							<p>SMBs and enterprise clients experience a range of business benefits when they outsource their IT. Here are five of the most common:</p>
							<div class="faq__grid">
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Strategic Focus –</h5>
									<p>How much time does your IT department spend on break-fix tickets? Are high priority initiatives sitting on the back-burner for lack of bandwidth? By outsourcing routine IT processes, companies free up time to focus on business-critical initiatives. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Staff Augmentation –</h5>
									<p>By leveraging staff augmentation, companies can accommodate internal staff changes, seasonal demand, and strategic growth. Technical consultants can be deployed as needed, in-office and remotely.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Optimized IT Spend –</h5>
									<p>When you don't have a clear view of your IT infrastructure, it's easy to overpay for extraneous services while failing to invest in business-critical ones. Working with an MSP makes it easier to invest strategically in your IT.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Industry Best Practices –</h5>
									<p>Having immediate access to industry IT experts is invaluable. A technical consulting firm gives you access to expert best practices and cross-functional industry knowledge. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">IT Governance –</h5>
									<p>You want an MSP that's cognizant of rapidly shifting regulatory landscapes, even those that don't directly impact your industry. From GDPR to the CCPA, your MSP should have an expert understanding of how these regulations impact your IT infrastructure.</p>
