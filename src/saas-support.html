However, the cost of maintaining such specialists in-house can prove to be costly, especially for startups, small and medium-sized businesses. A lot of times executives such as the CTO or VP, or Engineering will have to perform basic tech support functions, simply because it is too expensive to hire full-time tech support employees.</p>
