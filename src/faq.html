							<h3 class="accordion__title">What to outsource first?</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="accordion__hidden">
							<p>Although simple in principle, outsourcing is a significant step for your business. It is not advisable to outsource everything at once. Outsourcing is best completed according to a step-by-step plan over many months (depending on the complexity of your IT environment).</p>

							<h3 class="accordion__title">How Can Outsourced IT Help My Business?</h3>

						<div class="accordion__hidden">
							<p>SMBs and enterprise clients experience a range of business benefits when they outsource their IT. Here are five of the most common:</p>
							<div class="faq__grid">
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Strategic Focus –</h5>
									<p>How much time does your IT department spend on break-fix tickets? Are high priority initiatives sitting on the back-burner for lack of bandwidth? By outsourcing routine IT processes, companies free up time to focus on business-critical initiatives. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Staff Augmentation –</h5>
									<p>By leveraging staff augmentation, companies can accommodate internal staff changes, seasonal demand, and strategic growth. Technical consultants can be deployed as needed, in-office and remotely.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Optimized IT Spend –</h5>
									<p>When you don't have a clear view of your IT infrastructure, it's easy to overpay for extraneous services while failing to invest in business-critical ones. Working with an MSP makes it easier to invest strategically in your IT.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">Industry Best Practices –</h5>
									<p>Having immediate access to industry IT experts is invaluable. A technical consulting firm gives you access to expert best practices and cross-functional industry knowledge. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq__grid-item">
									<h5 class="h6">IT Governance –</h5>
									<p>You want an MSP that's cognizant of rapidly shifting regulatory landscapes, even those that don't directly impact your industry. From GDPR to the CCPA, your MSP should have an expert understanding of how these regulations impact your IT infrastructure.</p>
