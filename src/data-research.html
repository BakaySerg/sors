							<p>Finding a dataset that contains the exact types of images you need can be a time-consuming endeavor. Instead of scouring the internet or paying for a dataset that doesn’t match your needs, trust our data collection for computer vision services will do this work for you.</p>
							<p>Simply tell us what you are looking for in the images and what you would like the model to learn and we will take it from there. Our services scope covers a wide area of image data collection and image data annotation services for all forms of machine learning and deep learning applications.</p>

							<p>We know the amount of audio data necessary to train an NLP, voice-to-text on, or any other machine learning model that can understand human speech. The audio must contain specific nuances found in dialogues such as irony, sarcasm, and many other details.</p>
							<p>We can collect the needed training data with the right pronunciation lexicons, both general and domain-specific (e.g. names, places, natural numbers). The datasets can also be text corpora annotated for morphological information and named entities.</p>

							<p>Nowadays machines are being taught how to read, understand, analyze, and produce text in a valuable way for technological interactions with humans. However, for a machine to understand the natural language of humans they need to be trained with sufficient amounts of quality data.</p>
							<p>We can collect the data set for machine learning with all kinds of sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) and also with the right intent behind the text, such as a command, request, or confirmation.</p>

							<p>Biometric data sets can be hard to find since this is personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person. This can be things like facial images, geolocations, and lots of other data.</p>
							<p>We can help you collect the needed training data while remaining compliant with all of the laws and regulations surrounding the collection and handling of such data.</p>
